			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>Hello my name is David Ersa Pramudita. I am a student from senior high school 1 Berbek. I was born and raised in Nganjuk, East Java. My hobby is playing games. I really like playing games because it's very exciting. My favorite food is chicken, and my favorite drink is orange juice. I also have a family consisting of both my parents and me.</p>
			<p>I am currently participating in the Golden Ticket program organized by <strong> South East Asia Minister of Education Organization (SEAMEO)</strong>, which is collaborating with the <strong> Surabaya State Electronics Polytechnic (PENS)</strong>. The reason I joined this program is because besides I like <strong> Informatics Engineering (IT)</strong>, I am also interested in learning the metaverse</p>
			<h3>ABOUT MY GOAL</h3>
			<p>My goal is to become a professional and responsible programmer. The reason I want to be a programmer is because I want to make a game where the game has a realistic open world theme with the real world. Because I've always wanted to play an open world game by adding features like in the real world. Besides wanting to make games, I also want to make my parents happy.</p>
